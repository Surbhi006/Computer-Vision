# Ostu Algorithm

## Steps:

* Load the image.
* Then calculate values for histogram and create histogram.
* Calculate weight, mean and class variance for foreground and background of a image.
* The next step is to calculate the 'Within-Class Variance'. This is simply the sum of the two variances multiplied by their associated weights.
* Then append result of withian-class variance into a threshold list.
* Find mininum value and it’s index from the threshold list.
* Now iterate over length and breadth of an image and compare each pixel value of image with threshold value if it’s greater set as 255 otherwise 0.
* Now plot the resutig image.
